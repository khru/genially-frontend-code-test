# 🗒️ Project Logbook

A concise record of changes made to modernize and standardize the codebase. The project started as a JavaScript React app scaffolded with Create React App on Node.js 16.

## 🔧 Environment & Standards
- Added `.nvmrc` to align the development runtime (moved baseline from Node.js 16 to **Node.js 22**).
- Added `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent editor settings across contributors.

## 📚 Documentation
- Added `AGENTS.md` to surface agent-related context and make it easy to reference within the repo.

## 🛠️ TypeScript Migration
- Migrated the React codebase from **JavaScript to TypeScript**.
- Converted source files to `.ts`/`.tsx` and introduced project-wide typing.

## 🚀 Runtime & Dependencies
- Upgraded the project to **Node.js 22**.
- Updated all dependencies to the latest compatible versions and refreshed the lockfile.

## ✅ Outcome
- The app now runs on a unified Node.js 22 baseline.
- The codebase is fully TypeScript-based with consistent editor standards and accessible documentation.
