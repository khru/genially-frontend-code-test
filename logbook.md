# üóíÔ∏è Project Logbook

A concise record of changes made to modernize and standardize the codebase. The project started as a JavaScript React
app scaffolded with Create React App on Node.js 16.

## üîß Environment & Standards

- Added `.nvmrc` to align the development runtime (moved baseline from Node.js 16 to **Node.js 22**).
- Added `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent editor settings across contributors.

## üìö Documentation

- Added `AGENTS.md` to surface agent-related context and make it easy to reference within the repo.

## üõ†Ô∏è TypeScript Migration

- Migrated the React codebase from **JavaScript to TypeScript**.
- Converted source files to `.ts`/`.tsx` and introduced project-wide typing.

## üöÄ Runtime & Dependencies

- Upgraded the project to **Node.js 22**.
- Updated all dependencies to the latest compatible versions and refreshed the lockfile.
- Added Prettier, ESLint (with React/Testing Library plugins), and lint-staged to automate formatting, linting, and
  staged-file checks.

## üß± Architecture

- `src/domain` now concentrates pure concepts: factories (`BoxFactory`) and ports (`CanvasStateRepository`,
  `DragAdapter`) with no framework dependencies.
- Introduced `CanvasPositionLimiter` to wrap `clampPositionWithinBounds` so the app-level rule (‚Äúclamp only when bounds
  exist‚Äù) lives alongside other policies instead of leaking into MST actions.
- `src/application` hosts use-case services (`BoxService`, `BoxSelectionService`, `BoxColorService`) that orchestrate
  the domain and expose operations to the UI/MST layer.
- `src/infrastructure` implements those ports via concrete adapters (`LocalStorageCanvasStateRepository`,
  `InteractDragAdapter`).
- `src/ui` holds React-specific wiring (for example `DragAdapterProvider`) that injects adapters into components.
- The main store (`src/stores/MainStore.ts`) hydrates state through MST actions (`hydrateBoxes`,
  `addBoxAtDefaultPosition`) and persists snapshots via the repository, preventing ‚Äúoutside action‚Äù mutations while
  keeping reactivity intact.
- The canvas keeps delegating interaction through callbacks (`updateBoxPosition`, `removeSelectedBoxes`), which
  preserves the separation between presentation and domain logic.

## üß™ Testing Improvements

- Introduced React Testing Library coverage for `App`, focusing on user-visible behaviour of the toolbar and canvas
  updates.
- Reset MobX-State-Tree snapshots between tests to keep suites deterministic and isolated.
- Documented a TDD-first testing approach in `AGENTS.md` so future changes start with failing tests.
- Added unit test suites for the box factory, box service, selection service, box colour service, and service worker to
  lock down domain and infrastructure behaviour.
- Added drag-and-drop behavioural specs (App + BoxDraggable) using a deterministic interact.js mock to ensure boxes move
  without pre-selection and persist updated coordinates.
- Added infrastructure coverage for the localStorage repository (including invalid JSON handling) so noisy logs are
  suppressed in tests while behaviour stays verified.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- The app now runs on a unified Node.js 22 baseline.
- The codebase is fully TypeScript-based with consistent editor standards and accessible documentation.

## Final thoughts

**Items I left out of the technical exercise due to time constraints:**

- Undo/Redo functionality.

**UX/UI improvement points:**

- By default, a single click should select one box, and Shift + click should enable multi-select. I am aware of this
  behavior. However, to avoid handling keyboard events given the time constraints, I chose to default to multi-select
  instead of single select.
- Drag to select also differs from a typical UI. Normally, dragging does not select. In my case it does. This is a
  conscious trade-off to keep things simple.
- On mobile, the ‚ÄúAdd box‚Äù action does not work. I have observed the issue, and due to time constraints I decided to
  postpone the fix for now.
- Design feedback: on mobile, ‚ÄúAdd box‚Äù is not rendering well and does not work reliably. Could you take a look, please?
